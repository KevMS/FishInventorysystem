# Fish Inventory System

**Project Overview**

This Fish Inventory System was developed in 2022 by myself and two classmates as a part of our Web2 subject project. The primary goal of this project was to create a web application that would help manage and display fish inventory efficiently. This system allows users to browse through a gallery of fish, view pricing, and make purchases, while also providing an administrative panel for managing the inventory, orders, sales, and users.

**Features**

1. Fish Gallery and Pricing: Users can explore the homepage to view different fish species along with their prices. The gallery is designed to be user-friendly, allowing customers to easily browse and select their desired fish.

2. Access Log: The system includes an access log feature to track user activities, ensuring transparency and security.

3. Fish Categorization: Fish are categorized to help users quickly find specific types of fish based on categories, enhancing the user experience.

4. Admin Panel: An administrative panel is available for managing the inventory, orders, sales, and user information. This panel is designed to simplify management tasks and improve overall efficiency.

5. Orders and Sales Management: Administrators can manage customer orders and sales data, providing insights into business performance and customer preferences.

6. User Management: Admins can manage user accounts, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to the admin panel and system data.

**Notes**
This system was developed in 2022, and while it fulfills the basic requirements of a fish inventory system, it is not perfect. There are areas that require improvement, including design enhancements and process optimization.

The system may contain bugs or errors that need to be addressed. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

**Future Improvements**
Design Enhancements: Improve the overall design and user interface to make the system more visually appealing and intuitive.

Performance Optimization: Enhance the system's performance by optimizing code and database queries.

Feature Expansion: Add new features such as advanced search options, user reviews, and payment gateway integration for a better user experience.

Security Improvements: Implement additional security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

Conclusion
This Fish Inventory System serves as a foundational project that demonstrates the basic principles of web development and inventory management. It provides a solid starting point for further development and enhancement. We encourage users and developers to explore, modify, and contribute to this project to make it even better.
